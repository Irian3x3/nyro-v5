<h1 align="center">Nik's Utilities Privacy Policy</h1>

Thank you for using Nik's Utilites! As of discord's requirements, we must provide data concerns.

If you do not agree with these terms, do not continue using any of our service(s).

In [discord's ToS](https://discord.com/terms), it states that you must be 13+ or older. If you are under the age of 13, do not use this bot. We cannot save data on children under the age of 13.

### What we save

We save data that the user inputs only. Specifcally, we save:

- Guild ID's (Guild settings)
- User ID's (Per-user customization)
- Channel ID's (Only saved when user provides, and they are used for logging)
- Moderation Reasons (Only for moderation commands)
- Command logs (We only log user tags + ids, and the command name)

And everything but not limited to data the user (you) gives to the bot.

### Who we share your data with

We do not share your data with any third party applications, and the data is only accessablie by us, locally.

---

### Why we need this information

We only use this information for both customization and for fun related commands.

Fun related commands can be the tag command, for example. In that instance, that data is used when someone runs the tag.

---

### Where can I access/delete my data saved on me?

1. You can use the `n!data` command. Check the help command for that command for usage(s).
2. You can join the [support server](https://discord.gg/YdHkWMm) and request/delete your data by sending a message to the Owners.

**You can only delete/request **your** data, if you do not own said server, or are not that user, we may refuse to disclose that information to you.**
